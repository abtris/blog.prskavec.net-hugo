Status: Accepted on 2020-08-17


## Context

Deployment can be done into CDN and static pages (Github Pages, S3, Netlify)

## Decision

I choose Netlify for custom domain with TLS and very good support for Hugo.

## Consequences

Not big consequences, migration can be easy if we need it. Just custom domain is more work usually, solution in Netlify is nice and easy.
