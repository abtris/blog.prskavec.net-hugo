## Context

All my website are updated only a few times per year and I need that will works without backend system.

## Decision

I decide using plain html over Wordpress, Ghost or similar solution for simplify process publishing new articles using only git and my current editor (VSCode). No costs for hosting and better reliability than my own hosting.

## Consequences

I'm limited what can be run, but for blog, posts and similar content isn't big deal.
